# Surface-unevennes-detection-using-sonars-linked-with-ThingSpeak-IoT-
The real-life problem solved by this project is the detection of the unevenness of road in real time. This car will be able to detect any unevenness of the surface it is passing by with the help of few sensors and it will record the data in real time while plotting the data on the internet using IoT (Internet of things). This project is a programmable car. The microcontroller used is an ATmega-328. The car has an array of two SONAR sensors facing towards its front bottom which will determine the dimensions of the cavity on the surface of the road. The car will be able to move in all eight directions i.e. front, back, left, right, forward right, forward left, backward right and backward left.  The carâ€™s circuit accesses the internet with the help a Wi-Fi module which is connected to internet. The sonars on the car detect the cavities and the data is recorded in the ATmega-328 which sends the data to the ThingSpeak server with the help of the Wi-Fi module and ThingSpeak processes the data and plots it. This project can be used by road surveying companies in order to know where exactly they need to repair.
